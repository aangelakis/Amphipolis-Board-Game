# Amphipolis Board Game
---
**How to run the game:** There is no executable .jar file for this program. If you want to play the game you have to open the project in an IDE (I used Eclipse but other IDEs work too) and run the Main Class provided in the source files.

---
**How to play and rules:** When you run the game you will see a "Help" button on the Menu bar. There you can find the link of the youtube videos of the "How to play Amphipolis" in Greek, but also in English. The game supports only 4 players at the moment.

**How the GUI works in a nutshell:**
1) Each player before making any move, has to draw tiles from the bag of the game. This happens by clicking the red button "Draw Tiles".
2) After step 1), the player can draw tiles from the board of the game by clicking on the tile he wants to pick up. 
3) If the player wants to draw more than 2 tiles from the board, he can use a special character of the game by clicking on him.
4) The player can now end his turn by clicking the red button "End Turn".
5) Each player's inventory is shown at the bottom of the window.
6) There is a "to do" list for the tasks of each player. All the tasks are obligatory, except the optional one.
7) If you want to exit the game, simply click the "Settings" button on the Menu and press "Exit Game" (there is no saving in this game).
8) If you want to pause, stop or resume the music, click the "Music" button on the Menu and click on the button you want.

The above doesn't help you with the rules of the game. If you are not familiar with the board game, watch the "How to play" video.

A new game starts when you run the game everytime.
